        "- Batch Processing & Organization: Upscales images from multiple subfolders in one go, preserving your original folder structure in the output.\n",
        "- VRAM Optimization: Features a configurable Tiling mechanism (recommended $1024 \\text{ px}$ for T4 GPUs) to prevent Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors and significantly speed up processing of large images.\n",
        "- Smart Cropping: Allows selection of multiple target aspect ratios (e.g., $1:1, 4:3, 16:9$). The script automatically crops each image to the closest matching selected ratio to minimize content loss.\n",
        "- Quality Control & Cleanup: Includes options for zero-padded file renaming, format conversion (e.g., PNG to JPG), optional final rescaling, and a cleanup step to remove the _out suffix for cleaner final file names.\n",
        "- Final Delivery: Features a final step to automatically batch-zip each resulting output subfolder for easy download."
